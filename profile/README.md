## Buwang.in
Buwang.in is a project that aims to address the problem of abundant waste production in current waste management. As one of the largest waste-producing countries in the world, Indonesia has around 16 million tons of waste that has not been properly managed and ends up in landfills or even in the environment. This can be caused by the lack of knowledge about the separation of waste based on its type.

# Background
Abundant waste production is the main challenge of waste management nowadays. As one of the highest waste-producing countries in the world, Indonesia has around 16 million tons of waste that has not been managed properly and ends up in landfills or even in the environment. It could be caused by a lack of knowledge about separating waste based on its type.

# Reason
Research questions:
1. How do we classify waste?
2. How do we utilize waste to make it valuable?
We chose this theme because waste can be a danger to the environment and humans. Apart from causing environmental pollution, piles of waste that are not managed properly can become breeding grounds for diseases. Our team hopes that the "Buwang.in" app can be one of the solutions to this problem by helping people manage waste and making waste have economic value.

# Existing Result
So far, there have been several apps that focus on waste classification. However, these applications are still limited in terms of functionality. For example, they can only perform waste classification without providing features such as waste quantity calculation, waste inventory, and so on. In this case, the "Buwang.in" application has the advantage of providing a more complete and comprehensive solution in managing waste and increasing the value of waste to become more valuable.
