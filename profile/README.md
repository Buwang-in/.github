# Buwang.in
Buwang.in is a project that aims to address the problem of abundant waste production in current waste management. As one of the largest waste-producing countries in the world, Indonesia has around 16 million tons of waste that has not been properly managed and ends up in landfills or even in the environment. This can be caused by the lack of knowledge about the separation of waste based on its type.
